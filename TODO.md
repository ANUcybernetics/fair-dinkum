# TODO

- store player id in localStorage
- write slides (or notes, at least) for the workshop
- saladUI components
- host on fly.io

- maybe don't have the context metadata in the resource, because it's really
  only useful in-game (and serialising the game state to disk is a "later"
  problem)

## for later on

- have a proper registy, start the game servers dynamically

## other games

- taboo
- "make the LLM say your word" thing
- round the circle-type stuff (with an LLM intermediary in each case)

## workshop structure

- intro (LLM)

> the killer app for genAI is parlour games for overeducated wankers
>
> this is a demographic I know well, because I am one

- parlour: co-located humans. bored. night outside, drinks inside... and so

- games: keen to entertain one another

- for overeducated: word games, word play, show off

- wankers: (literally) self-indulgent. not about a bigger goal, or doing good in
  the world

## some examples

- 20 questions
- fictionary
- minister's cat
- you've probably got your own favourites

## mechanics of a parlour game

(in general)

```basic
10 one or more player(s) says something
20 one or more player(s) say something in response
30 goto 20
```

## LLMs could play

prompt -> response

## 20 questions example

## today's structure

- play 20qs (initially raw-dog, then with AIs)
- discuss the mechanics & gameplay
- design a new LLM-based parlour game (or just modify an existing one)

## remember

There's no higher purpose here. Parlour games for overeducated wankers.
